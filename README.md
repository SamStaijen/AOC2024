# AOC2024
2024 edition of advent of code.

## Own rules
1. My original goal was to use the least amount of chars per day, however because my haskell fluency needs some work, i have decided to ditch that project and do the AOC in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) instead, as to make the language (and the functional paradigm in general) more my own.
2. Thy shall not pass - uhh - exceed 45 minutes of work per day. I have more important things to do, and lack of restriction will result in too much time for AOC.
3. Have fun!

## Leaderboards:
I will attent 2 private leaderboards;
- One from my current job.
- One from [Sticky](https://svsticky.nl/), the study association I am currently a member of.
